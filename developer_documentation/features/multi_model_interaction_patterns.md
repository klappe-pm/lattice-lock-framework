# Multi-Model Interaction Patterns

## Multi-Model Interaction Patterns

### Chain of Thought

Sequential processing through multiple models:

```python
chain = orchestrator.create_model_chain(tasks)
```

### Parallel Consensus

Multiple models vote on the answer:

```python
consensus = orchestrator.create_consensus_group(prompt, num_models=3)
```

### Hierarchical Refinement

Start cheap, refine with better models:

```python
result = await hierarchical_refinement(prompt, refinements)
```

### Adaptive Analysis

Depth adjusts to complexity:

```python
result = await adaptive_analysis(prompt, depth="auto")
```

[[Model Orchesterator Key Features]]

# Model Orchestrator Components Descriptions

## API Integration Layer

**API Clients Factory**: Unified interface for all providers
**Provider Clients:** Specialized clients for each API provider
**Zen MCP Bridge:** Integration with Model Context Protocol

## Core Orchestrator

**ModelOrchestrator:** Main routing engine that coordinates all operations
**ModelGuideParser:** Parses MODELS.md for task-to-model mappings and rules
**Configuration:** YAML-based configuration for system behavior

## Cost Optimization

**Cost Tracker:** Real-time tracking per model and task
**Budget Manager:** Enforces spending limits
**Tier Selection:** Balances quality vs cost based on task criticality

## Local Model Management

**LocalModelManager:** Manages Ollama local models
**Keep Models Loaded:** Ensures models stay in memory for performance
**RAM Monitor:** Tracks memory usage and prevents overload
**Warmup Scripts:** Pre-loads models for instant availability

## Model Registry

**ModelCapabilities:** Comprehensive profiles for each model including:
- Performance metrics (speed, accuracy, reasoning depth)
- Cost per million tokens
- Task affinity scores
- Feature support (vision, function calling, streaming)
**ModelProvider Enum:** 9 model providers
- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- Google
- XAI
- Local
- DIAL
- Zen MCP
- Azure
- Bedrock
**Performance History:** Tracks actual performance for continuous improvement

## Quality & Monitoring

**Quality Gates:** Validation checkpoints for output quality
**Performance Metrics:** Latency, accuracy, cost tracking
**Structured Logging:** Comprehensive audit trail
**Benchmarks:** Performance validation suite

## Selection Engine

**Model Selection Algorithm:** Multi-factor scoring system
- Task affinity scores
- Quality requirements
- Cost constraints
- Availability checks
- Performance history
**Fallback Chain Handler:** Automatic failover when primary model unavailable
**Consensus Mode:** Multiple models for critical tasks
**Parallel Execution Engine:** Concurrent model queries for speed

## Task Analysis

**TaskType Enum:** 14 task categories including:
- code generation
- reasoning
- vision
**TaskRequirements:** Specifications for context window, capabilities, constraints
**Task Affinity Scoring:** Matches tasks to models based on capability scores

## Testing Framework

**Unit Tests:** Core functionality verification
**Integration Tests:** API client validation
**Concurrent Tests:** Parallel execution validation
**Real World Tests:** End-to-end scenario validation

## User Interface Layer

**CLI Interface:** Command-line interface for direct orchestrator interaction
**API Endpoints:** REST API for programmatic access
**User Input:** Direct user queries and task specifications
